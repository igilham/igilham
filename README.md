I'm a software developer currently working on smart speaker apps for the BBC.

I've previously spent time on data publishing systems, MPEG video multiplexing, apps for broadcast TV and financial data streaming libraries. I've dabbled in the odd website over the years as well.

I like to play with different languages but I've most recently worked with NodeJS (Javascript and Typescript) and Java (Spring Boot etc.). I've also used C++, C#, Python, Go and a handfull of other languages when the interest takes me.
